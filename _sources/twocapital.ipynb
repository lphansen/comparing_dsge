One way to overcome this is to first run a two-dimensional version of the two-capital (abstracting from $Z^2$) for $\\rho=1$ and use the solution to this model as an initial guess for more complex models. Even the two-dimensional case may take several hours to run; therefore, we advise against using this Jupyter Notebook directly and instead direct users to use remote-computing resources as described on the GitHub repository.\n",
