# Heterogenous Agents Model with Frictions

The subfolder solves three-dimenisonal heterogenous-agent production economies in sections 5.3.1, 5.3.2, 5.3.3 using neural nets.

## Scripts Overview

1. **run_1.sh**
   - **main_BFGS.py**: Executes the model RF / SG / PR using the scipy L-BFGS-B solver.
     - **utils_para.py**: Generates parameters in the model
     - **utils_training.py**: Defines HJB and FOC loss functions
     - **utils_DGM.py**: Neural nets basic structures
2. **run_2.sh**
   - **main_variable.py**: Evaluates the solved models on validation sets, calculate stationary densities and validation errors
3. **run_3.sh**
   - **main_pde_shock_elasticity.py**: Calculates shock elasticities by solving PDE
     - **utils_pde_shock_elasticity.py**: Contains source files for continuous-time shock elasticity PDE computations.
4. **run_4.sh**
   - **main_sim_shock_elasticity.py**: Calculates shock elasticities by simulation
     - **utils_sim_shock_elasticity.py**: Contains source files for continuous-time shock elasticity simulations.
5. **results.ipynb**: Load model solution, plot risk prices, equilibrium varibles, shock elasticities.

## Generated Directory Structure

Running the above bash scripts organizes the outputs and logs into specific directories to streamline troubleshooting and monitoring of script execution:

1. **job-outs**
   - Contains all log and error files associated with the script runs.
     - **run_'seed'.err**: Generated by run_1.sh, records the training error information
     - **run_'seed'.out**: Generated by run_1.sh, records the training time information
     - **val_'seed'.err**: Generated by run_2.sh, records the validation error information
     - **val_'seed'.out**: Generated by run_2.sh
     - **ela_'seed'.err**: Generated by run_3.sh
     - **ela_'seed'.our**: Generated by run_3.sh
     - **simela_'seed'.err**: Generated by run_4.sh
     - **simela_'seed'.our**: Generated by run_4.sh
2. **bash**
   - Stores sbatch files for each parameter set, which are used to submit jobs to a computing cluster.
3. **output**
   - Holds the computed model solutions and other outputs.
     - **sim_NN**: Contains the solved neural network models.
     - ***_NN.npy**: Contains state variables, equilibrium variables, stationary densities, and important derivatives, all evaluated on state-space validation sets.
     - ***_MSE.npy**: Contains validation errors
     - **NN_info.json**: Contains neural net structure and training information
     - **eva_V_*.npz**: Contains evaluations of important state variables, equilibrium variables evaluated on specific percentile validation sets 
     - ***.npz**: Contains shock elasticities
4. **data**
   - Contains all parameters used in the models.

## Estimated Running Time
1. **run_1.sh**: < 3 mins
2. **run_2.sh**: < 3 mins
3. **run_3.sh**: < 15 mins
4. **run_4.sh**: < 2 mins (tested on 45 cores)

Each task was tested on a single core of Intel Xeon Gold 6248R using the parameters in the bash file, with multiple tasks run simultaneously, except for **run_4.sh**, which was tested on 45 cores.
